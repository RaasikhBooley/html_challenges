                <h1>What is a Header</h1>
                    <p>The header is used to define a section for the element that contains it. It can be used as a header for a whole page (the most common usage), but can also be used as the header for an article or any other piece of on-page content.</p>

                        <p>Google Chrome is a free, open-source web browser developed by Google, released in 2008.</p>
                </article>            

                <!-- Explain the purpose of the section element. -->
                <h1>Section</h1>
                    <p>The "section" tag defines sections in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document. The "div" tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document. The "div" tag is used to group block-elements to format them with CSS.</p>
            
                <!-- Explain the purpose of the footer element. -->
               <h1>Footer</h1> 
                    <p>The "footer" tag is used for defining the lower part of an HTML document or section. Although footers are typically located at the bottom of a document, this is not required (although it cannot be placed within a "header" or another "footer" element, and it cannot contain a "header" element).</p>
